![106 days of code, and yes, I've missed 3 days¬†ü§∑‚Äç](/wrapping-up-100daysofcode-cover.jpeg)

_For those of you who stumble upon this post without any context, at the beginning of July, I've committed to continue the_ [_challenge of #30DaysOfCode_](https://bit.ly/2PyhrLb) _until I reach 100 days. You can read about it_ [_here._](https://bit.ly/2mDqxbl)

Summer is over and that means my challenge of coding for 1 hour every day finished. And what a ride has it been!

## **What was different this¬†time?**

While doing something for 30 days it's not that hard, staying consistent for 100 days is demanding.

Summer made the whole challenge more difficult. Beautiful weather, fun activities and a bunch of great people to hang out with made sitting down every day for an hour tough.

Actually, there were 3 days, when I completely failed and did not write a single line of code. When it first happened, I felt frustrated and sad that I broke the streak.

And then I started thinking about the reasons I've started the whole challenge. I realized that it was never about the numbers and maintaining a perfect streak. It was all about acquiring the habit of engaging in the creative process.

Looking at it that way, the challenge was a complete success. Nowadays I always make sure to set aside at least 1 hour of focus every day. Taking daily steps towards our goals pays off better than running a marathon every once in a while.

## What did I¬†build?

I always wanted to have a website, but it felt too much work. But now it finally happened! Most of the time in the last 2 months I've spent coding it.

You can check it out [here](https://bit.ly/2mmvTYj). It will always be a work in progress, but now at least is up and running. And it's such a great feeling to have a place where I can do whatever I want.

I built my site with [GatsbyJS](https://bit.ly/2kDrJuG) using [React](https://bit.ly/2zEJSfA) with [TypeScript](https://bit.ly/2mLC8Fx). I put together the design by myself as well, with a couple of inspirations from the internet.

I did not go with simple website builders like [WordPress](https://bit.ly/2mJXa7p) or [Squarespace](https://bit.ly/2mlSlAM), because I wanted to be in control of the whole flow. This makes it easy to try out any ideas I have.

### Smaller projects

I've published my very first [open-source project](https://bit.ly/2kFPjqI)(more on that later), a small project to monitor [stock levels](https://bit.ly/2l3zgn2) of the phone I wanted to buy and worked a lot on my [shopping list app](https://bit.ly/2kDrRdE).

## What's next?

I am going to continue with this habit. But I don't feel the need to hold myself accountable by posting it to my socials all the time. I feel that creating became a natural part of my life.

I am going to modify the challenge from _1 hour of coding_ to **1 hour of engaging in the creative process.**

This can be coding, writing or taking photographs. 1 hour will be the minimum time I want to spend on it every day, but I hope this will be much more in general.

I am going to apply the ["2-day rule"](https://bit.ly/2mDqIDx) as well, which allows me to skip the habit for 1 day, but not for 2 consecutive days.

I encourage you to join me! It's incredible how many things you can achieve by working a little for it every day.

Thanks for reading! üôè
