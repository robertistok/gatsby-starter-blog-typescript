> Relocating to a new country, leaving behind family, friends and familiar places is hard, no matter if the reason for the move is to experience a new culture, study at your dream university or just pure financial ones.

As someone who temporarily left behind his country and ended up moving to the beautiful city Stockholm, Sweden, I would like to share with you the things I've considered before making the big leap and how I've tried to make the process smoother.

## 1. Know your motivation

> I think this is one of the most important parts of this article. Without knowing why you are doing it, it will be hard to get used to your new life, enjoy its moments and stay on track both mentally and physically.

Being aware of my goals helps me a lot in the moments when the situation does not turn out as I expect.

### Professional development

One of the main reasons why I did not accept a job in Romania, is because I wanted to _work on a product_. Unfortunately, product development is still in early stages back home, so I needed to look somewhere else. By working at a product company, I can _get a much better understanding of the whole business, including sales, operations, and finances_.

### Personal development

In Stockholm, being a very international city, you can do almost anything. Coming from an environment where the opportunities are limited, it is really fun _experiencing_ a bunch of different things. _Connecting_ with open and smart people, trying out _food from all over the world_, learning to dance _salsa_ or just hiking in the surrounding nature are _just_ some of them.

### Financial benefits

I would lie if I said that I've never considered the monetary upsides before moving. Sweden, having high standards of living, makes it easier to _save up_ a lot of money while also enjoying life in the _present moment_.

## 2. Try to find a job before¬†moving

I know that this is a hard one, especially if you don't speak the language. However, **leveraging the power of the internet** can get you far in getting an offer. I think one of the best ways to achieve this, is through [**LinkedIn**](https://bit.ly/2OMrsAp), at least this is what has worked for me. You can connect with _recruiters_ operating in your industry, people working at companies who _can get your resume in front of the right people_ or just search amongst the opportunities posted on the [_job board_](https://bit.ly/2zEJEoK).

Having a company on your side will make the whole relocation less stressful. They can help you find an apartment, open up a bank account, get the necessary tax-related documents or just give some of the must-know information about the country.

## 3. Make sure to visit the¬†place

I've almost moved to Stockholm without even visiting the place and that might have been a bad idea. Kudos to [Martin](https://bit.ly/2zGyfET), our CEO, who did not let this happen üôè.

Even a short visit of a couple of days, can get you an overview of the city, give you the possibility to talk with the locals and decide whether it is a place you can imagine yourself living at.

If you can manage to find a company beforehand, it is even better as you will achieve two things in one shot. **First**, they might fly you out for the onsite interview and **second**, you will have the chance to meet your future colleagues. This could definitely make the whole process more comfortable, as you will manage to eliminate some of the unknown factors from the moving equation.

I _must say_, that visiting a place for a few days is totally different from actually living there. As no city is perfect, you will discover the hidden gems and the imperfections after spending more time there.

## 4. Make connections

Having friends to hang out and share experiences with is _an important thing for everybody_, especially if you are in a new place where nobody knows you.

### But how do you deal with this situation?

Now, this is a question for which there is no easy answer. It depends a lot on your personality, the country and city you moved to and the type of work you are gonna do.

However, _thanks to the internet_, this is much easier than it used to be. Applications like [Meetup](https://bit.ly/2zEJJJ4), [Couchsurfing](https://bit.ly/2zEJM7I), [Internations](https://bit.ly/2zJQf1i), [Instagram](https://bit.ly/2zEJNbM) and different [Facebook](https://bit.ly/2zFnMJN) groups make it possible to connect with hundreds of people and attend a bunch of different events on almost any topic.

Apart from the internet, you can also try to join a _language school, dance classes or board games events_, just to mention a few.

## 5. Costs of¬†living

I think this point affects more people who are coming from a _low prosperity country, are going to study or will not have a job lined up_. **Starting out is difficult**, no matter what your situation is, but if you are in one of the three situations mentioned before, it will be somewhat harder.

However, if you have money saved up to cover the months when you will not receive any income, you will be fine. _Just make sure to be aware of_ what and approximately how much these costs could be.

After the initial "_shock_" is over and you manage to get a decent income, usually everything should work out. Even if a country has high costs of living, the wages will be in most of the cases adjusted to them.

## 6. Learn the¬†language

Depending on your work and country, you may get by with speaking only English. However, _learning the local language will be super important_, no matter where you go. Interacting with people in their native language will make you **feel included in society**. Even in Sweden, where everybody speaks perfect English, I feel that it would be _much easier to be part of the local communities_ if I would know the language.

Attending **a language school** might be the fastest and most effective way to master the language. You can even make some _new friends_ on the way, likely there will be other students facing similar challenges as you and will be more than happy to chat with you. If you have a job, you can even ask your company _to help you out_.

As I was traveling quite a lot and attending a course takes a lot of time, this was not an option for me. However, I managed to get quite far only with [_Duolingo_](https://bit.ly/317yzsm). It is really convenient to learn with this app, as you can do it anytime from anywhere, you just need to be **persistent** and do it **every day at least 15--30 minutes.**

Consuming content in the given language and having actual conversations will speed up the process, no matter what way you choose.

## Final thoughts

I need to mention, that this list just gives you information about what I personally considered before moving to Stockholm. Apart from the six points mentioned, there are also the obvious things like **your relationships**, political and economic**stability** ofthe country, **housing** and the **weather** for example.

I can highly recommend everyone to try out living abroad, even if it is only for a short period. It is a _fantastic_ experience and it makes you grow as a person **tremendously**.

Thanks for reading! üôè
